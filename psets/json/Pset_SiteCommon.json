Please note that several site attributes are handled directly at the IfcSite instance, the site number (or short name) by IfcSite.Name, the site name (or long name) by IfcSite.LongName, and the description (or comments) by IfcSite.Description. The land title number is also given as an explicit attribute IfcSite.LandTitleNumber. Actual site quantities, like site perimeter, site area and site volume are provided by IfcElementQuantity, and site classification according to national building code by IfcClassificationReference. The global positioning of the site in terms of Northing and Easting and height above sea level datum is given by IfcSite.RefLongitude, IfcSite.RefLatitude, IfcSite.RefElevation and the postal address by IfcSite.SiteAddress.",
