Please note that several space attributes are handled directly at the IfcSpace instance, the space number (or short name) by IfcSpace.Name, the space name (or long name) by IfcSpace:LongName, and the description (or comments) by IfcSpace.Description. Actual space quantities, like space perimeter, space area and space volume are provided by IfcElementQuantity, and space classification according to national building code by IfcClassificationReference. The level above zero (relative to the building) for the slab row construction is provided by the IfcBuildingStorey.Elevation, the level above zero (relative to the building) for the floor finish is provided by the IfcSpace.ElevationWithFlooring.",
